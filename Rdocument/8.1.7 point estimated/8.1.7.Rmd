## 8.1.7

A simple random sample is taken from a population and yields the following data for a variable of the population.
<br/>

**Find a point estimate for the population mean​ (that is, the mean of the​ variable).**


First, we need to get the data from Excel. (The approach below gets the data mannually)
```{r}
data <- c(11, 23, 38, 13, 35, 16, 36, 19, 16, 27)
```
<hr />
To find point estimated, we run
```{r}
mean(data)
```
Round to one decimal place as needed
```{r}
round(mean(data), 1)
```
<hr />
**Hope that helps!**
