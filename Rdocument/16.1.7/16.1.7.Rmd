## 16.1.7

An​ F-curve has df = (6, 4) Use an​ F-distribution table to find the​ F-value that has an area of 0.05 to its right.

<hr/>

Since $\alpha = .05$ the area to the left is .95

To find $F_{0.05}$ we run
```{r}
alpha = 0.05
qf(1-alpha, 6,4)
```
Round to two decimal places
```{r}
round(qf(1-alpha, 6,4) ,2)
```
<hr/>
**Hope that helps!**
