## 6.2.61
Determine the area under the standard normal curve that lies to the right of left parenthesis a right (a) z = -0.74 (b) z= -0.24 (c) z= -0.39 and (d) z= -0.12

<br/>

**(a) The area to the right of z= -0.74 is**
Using pnorm() return the area to the left, in order to get the area to the right use 1 - pnorm()
```{r}
1-pnorm(-0.74)
```
Round to four decimal places as needed.
Use round() command
```{r}
round(1-pnorm(-0.74), 4)
```
<hr />
**(b) The area to the right of z= -0.24 is**

**(c) The area to the right of z= -0.39 is**

**(d) The area to the right of z= -0.12 is**

Using the same approachh to get the answer
```{r}
round(1-pnorm(-0.24), 4)
round(1-pnorm(-0.39), 4)
round(1-pnorm(-0.12), 4)
```

**Hope that helps!**
