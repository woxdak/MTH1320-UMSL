## 16.3.43

The data shown to the right are from independent simple random samples from three populations. Use these data to complete parts​ (a) through​ (d).

<br/>

<hr/>
Notation in one-way ANOVA:

  * k = number of populations
  
  *  n = total number of observations
  
  * $\bar x$ = mean of all n observations
  
  * $n_j$ = size of sample from Population j
  
  * $\bar{x_j}$ = mean of sample from Population j
  
  * $s_j^2$ = variance of sample from Population j
  
  * $T_j$ = sum of sample data from Population j
</hr>
Defining formulas from sums of squares in one-way ANOVA:

 * SST = $\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2$
  
 * SSTR = $\sum n_j(\bar{x_j} - \bar{x})^2$
  
 * SSE = $\sum (n_j-1)s_j^2$
  
<hr/>
One-way ANOVA identity: SST = SSTR + SSE
<hr/>
Computing formulas from sums of squares in one-way ANOVA:

 * SST = $\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2/n$
  
 * SSTR = $\sum (T_j^2/n_j) - (\sum x_i)^2/n$
  
 * SSE = SST - SSTR
  
  **The way they define $\sum (T_j^2/n_j)$ is different from the one for x**
<hr/>
Mean squares in one-way ANOVA:

 * MSTR = $\frac{SSTR}{k-1}$
  
 * MSE = $\frac{SSE}{n-k}$
  
 * SSE = SST - SSTR
  
<hr/>
Test statistic for one-way ANOVAA (independent samples, normal populations, and equal population standard deviations):

 * F = $\frac{MSTR}{MSE}$
  
with df = (k - 1, n - k)
  
<hr/>

Confidence interval for $\mu_i - \mu_j$ in the Tukey multiple-comparison method (independent samples, normal populations, and equal population sstandard deviations):

 * $(\bar{x_i} - \bar{x_j}) \pm \frac{q_{\alpha}}{\sqrt{2}}.s\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}}$

where s = $\sqrt{MSE}$ and $q_{\alpha}$ is obtained for a q-curve with parameters k and n - k
  
<hr/>
Test statistic for a Kruskal-Wallis test (independent samples, same-shape populations, all sample sizes 5 or greater):

  * $K=\frac{SSTR}{SST/(n-1)}$ or
  
  * $K=\frac{12}{n(n+1)}\sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{R_j^2}{n_j} - 3(n+1)$
  

where SSTR and SST are computed for the ranks of the data, and $R_j$ denotes the sum of the ranks for the sample data from Population j. K has approximately a chi-square distribution with df = k -1

**First, let $\mu_1, \mu_2,$ and $\mu_3$ be the population means times for 7​ a.m., 5​ p.m., and 12​ a.m., respectively. What are the correct hypotheses for a​ one-way ANOVA​ test?**

Since the question asks "At the​ 5% significance​ level, do the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that a difference exists in mean download​ speed?.", the correct hypothesis is.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$

$H_a:$ Not all the means are equal.
<hr/>
**Now conduct a​ one-way ANOVA test on the data. What is the​ F-statistic?**

First we need to get the data from the question. (We can import it from Excel)
```{r}
data <- read.csv("~/R/Chapter 2/16.3.49/16.3.49.csv")
data
```
The type of data is tibble in R. To avoid confusion when working with other question, we should create a data frame.
```{r}
dframe = data.frame(data)
dframe
```

**First approach: using anova() in R which Professor Covert introduces in the video lectures (recommended)**
```{r}
X <- c()
len <- c()
for(item in dframe){
  X <- c(X, item[!is.na(item)])
  len <- c(len, length(item[!is.na(item)]))
}
X
len
```
We import name of our data.
```{r}

Y= rep(names(dframe), times = len)
Y
```

```{r}
dframe2 = data.frame(X,Y)
dframe2
```
We run anova()
```{r}
fm1 = aov(X~Y, data=dframe2)
fm1
anova(fm1)
```
We can run str() to see structure of our data. We can extract any data from the frame. 
```{r}
str(anova(fm1))
```
Round to 2 decimal places
```{r}
print((anova(fm1)$`F value`), 4)
```

**Now determine the critical value $F_{\alpha}$**

Since $\alpha = .05$, df(2,15)
```{r}
qf(1-.05, 2, 15)
```
Round to decimal places
```{r}
round(qf(1-.05, 2, 15), 2)
```
Since our test statistic = 16.07 > our critical value $F_{\alpha}=3.68$ and it is a right-tailed test, we have enough evidence to reject the hypothesis.
<hr/>


**Second approach: using the formula from the book**
<hr/>
**The same approach with question 16.3.43, we could see that two approaches have the same answer**

**(a) Compute​ SST, SSTR, and SSE using the following computing​ formulas, where xi is the ith​ observation, n is the total number of​ observations, nj is the sample size for population​ j, and Tj is the sum of the sample data from population j.**

**Names of variables**

$\sum{x}: Sx$

$\sum x^2: Sxx$
$\sum (T_j^2/n_j)$: T

n = total number of observations: n

<hr/>


To make it easy to find $\sum x$, we store all data into a variable x
```{r}
x <- c()
for(item in dframe){
  x <- c(x, item[!is.na(item)])
}
x
n = length(x)
n
```
**Find $\sum x_i$**
```{r}
sum(x)
```
**Find $\sum x_i^2$**
```{r}
sum(x*x)
```
**Find SST **

To find SST, we use formula SST = $\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2/n$
```{r}
SST = sum(x*x) - (sum(x))^2/n
SST
```

**Find $\sum (T_j^2/n_j)$**
```{r}
T = 0
for(item in dframe){
  t =  item[!is.na(item)]
  T = T + sum(t)^2/length(t)
}
T
```
**Find SSTR, we use formula SSTR = $\sum (T_j^2/n_j) - (\sum x_i)^2/n$ **

```{r}
SSTR = T - sum(x)^2/n
SSTR
```
**Find SSE, we use formula SSE = SST - SSTR **

```{r}
SSE = SST - SSTR
SSE
```
**(b). Compare your results in part​ (a) for SSTR and SSE with the following results from the defining formulas.**

We find SSTR, SSE, SST by using defining formula 
 
**Find SST using the formula SST = $\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2$**
```{r}
SST = sum(x*x) - (sum(x))^2/n
SST
```
**Find SSTR using the formula SSTR = $\sum n_j(\bar{x_j} - \bar{x})^2$**
```{r}
SSTR = 0
for(item in dframe){
  t =  item[!is.na(item)]
  SSTR = SSTR + length(t)*(mean(t) - mean(x))^2
}
SSTR
```
**Find SSE using the formula SSE = $\sum (n_j-1)s_j^2$**
```{r}
SSE = 0
for(item in dframe){
  t =  item[!is.na(item)]
  SSE = SSE + (length(t)-1)*sd(t)^2
}
SSE
```
**We have the same answer by using two different formulas.**
<hr/>
**(c) Construct a​ one-way ANOVA table.**
<hr/>
**Find df treatment **
```{r}
k = length(dframe)
k-1
```
**Find SS treatment **
```{r}
SSTR
```
**Find MS treatment **
```{r}
MSTR = SSTR/(k-1)
MSTR
```
**Find Error df **
```{r}
n - k
```
**Find Error SS **
```{r}
SSE
```
**Find Error MS **
```{r}
MSE = SSE / (n - k)
MSE
```
**Find F-statistic treatment **
```{r}
MSTR / MSE
```
**Find df total**
```{r}
n - 1
```
**Find SS total**
```{r}
SST
```
<hr/>


**Now determine the critical value $F_{\alpha}$**

Since $\alpha = .05$
```{r}
alpha = 0.05
qf(1-alpha, k-1, n-k)
```
Round to decimal places
```{r}
round(qf(1-alpha, k-1, n-k), 2)
```
<hr/>
