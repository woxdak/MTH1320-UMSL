## 3.5.199

The​ heights, in​ inches, of the starting five players on a college basketball team are given below. 

Regarding the five players as a​ population, solve the following problems.
<br/>

First, we need to import the data from Excel.
(For simplicity, this imports mannual by hand, we can get the same result by importing dataset from Excel)
```{r}
x <- c(69, 72, 77 ,75, 85)
x
```
<hr />
**(a). Compute the population mean​ height, $\mu$**

```{r}
mean(x)
```
<hr />
**(b). Compute the population standard deviation of the​ heights, $\sigma$**
```{r}
sd(x)*sqrt((length(x)-1)/length(x))
```
Round to one decimal place
```{r}
round(sd(x)*sqrt((length(x)-1)/length(x)), 1)
```
<hr/>
**Hope that helps!**
