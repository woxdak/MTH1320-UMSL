## 13.3.43
The table provides data on gender and college for the students in one section of the course Introduction to Computer Science. In the​ table, we have used the abbreviations BUS for​ Business, ENG for Engineering and Applied​ Sciences, and LIB 

<br/>
<hr/>

**Group the bivariate data into a contingency table.**

First we need to get the data from the question. (We can import it from Excel)
```{r}
data <- read.csv("~/R/Chapter 2/13.3.43/13.3.43.csv")
data
```
We store data into 2 variables Gender and College
```{r}
Gender = data$Gender
College = data$College
```
First we can find total Male and Female
```{r}
table(Gender)
```
Then we can find the total of BUS, ENG, and LIB
```{r}
table(College)
```
We can finish a contingency table by running
```{r}
table(paste(College,Gender))
```
Total
```{r}
sum(as.integer(table(Gender)))
```

**Hope that helps!**
