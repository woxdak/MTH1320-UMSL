## Import data from Excel to R
<hr/>
```{r}
data <- read.csv("~/R/Chapter 2/Import data/Data1.csv")
data
```
The first row is converted to the name of the data. If the data from Excel does not have a name, we will miss one value by importing directly from Excel.
To avoid that, we should move the data from the first row to the last and give a name for the data.

For example, in the second data sheet I move A to the last row and give x as the name of the data.
```{r}
data2 <- read.csv("~/R/Chapter 2/Import data/Data2.csv")
data2
```
We can retrieve the data by using its name
```{r}
y = data2$x
y
```
