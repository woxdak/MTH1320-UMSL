## 13.1.5

For a $\chi^2$-curve with 22 degrees of​ freedom, find the chi squared
​-value that has area 0.05 to its right.

<br/>
$\chi_\alpha^2$ has $\alpha$ is the area to the right under $\chi$ curve 

We can get $\chi^2$ value by using the table or we can run qchisq()

qchisq() takes in the area to the left and degree of freedom

```{r}
qchisq(.95,22)
```
Round to three decimal places
```{r}
round(qchisq(.95,22),3)
```
