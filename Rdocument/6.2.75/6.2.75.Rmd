## 6.2.75
Use a standard normal distribution table to obtain theâ€‹ z-score that has an area of 0.99 to its right.

<br/>

Put the area to the left into qnorm(), it returns z-score

Since we have the area to the right
```{r}
qnorm(1-.99)
```
Round to two decimal places using round() command
```{r}
round(qnorm(1-.99),2)
```
