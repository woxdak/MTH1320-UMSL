**(a). The probability of selecting a jack is **

From the image, there are 4 jack cards. So the probability is $\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$

**(b). The probability of selecting a red card is **

From the image, there are 26 jack cards. So the probability is $\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}$

**(c). The probability of selecting a card that is not a heart is **

There are 13 heart cards. So the probability is $\frac{52-13}{52}=\frac{3}{4}$
