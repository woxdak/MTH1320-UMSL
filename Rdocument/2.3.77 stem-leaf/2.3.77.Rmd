## 2.3.77

A quantitative data set is provided in the table. Construct aâ€‹ stem-and-leaf diagram for the data, using one line per stem.

Choose the correct stem-and-leaf diagram.
<br/>

First, we need to import the data from Excel.
(For simplicity, this imports mannual by hand, we can get the same result by importing dataset from Excel)
```{r}
data <- c(40, 59, 45, 41, 62, 25, 43, 57, 35, 31)
data
```
<hr />
We can get stem-and-leaf diagram by using stem() command.

```{r}
stem(data)
```
<hr />
It is important to know how to get stem-and-leaf diagram. In this case, we rewrite each data value by split them into smaller digits. 
```{r}
data
```
40 -> 4|0 

59 -> 5|9

45 -> 4|5 

41 -> 4|1

62 -> 6|2 

43 -> 4|3

...

Add them together and arrange the number in increasing order, we have the final stem-and-leaf diagram and 

2|5

3|1 5

4|0 1 3 5

...

**Hope that helps!**
